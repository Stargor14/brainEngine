# CarnosaEngine, project scrapped/paused

## Topics: Evolutionary/Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks, Chess, Game theory

Neuroevolution/genetic algorithm based eval function training

Networks use asexual and sexual based reproduction, like the hoya carnosa plant

Feed forward network, potentially could be used for various other applications 
written in a very general way feel free to use neuro.cpp for other purposes

project used to learn about c memory managment and evolutionary computing/neural networks
